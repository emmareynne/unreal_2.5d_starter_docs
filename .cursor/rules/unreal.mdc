- i'm creating a guide for unreal engine. the guide will be for an experienced developer who has never used unreal or c++ before. Always use best practice. We want to take advantage of plugins where they would be in line with industry standard best practices. If we already have it installed in the project, be sure to leverage it where possible.
- we are using unreal engine 5.5. following best practice according to the official docs.
- we are incrementally implementing things so someone can follow along and learn from this guide.

- the end goal is a learning experience where we will have a reusable prototype for future projects at the end.
