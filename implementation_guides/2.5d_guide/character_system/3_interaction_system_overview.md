# Character Interaction System Overview

This guide introduces the interaction system for your 2.5D platformer in Unreal Engine 5.5, allowing your character to engage with the environment and objects in meaningful ways.

## What is the Interaction System?

The interaction system enables your character to:
- Detect and interact with environmental objects
- Trigger special animations for context-sensitive actions
- Grab, push, and pull objects in the world
- Activate switches, levers, and other mechanisms
- Collect items and power-ups

This system builds on our component-based architecture and integrates with the animation system from the previous guide.

## System Architecture

The interaction system consists of:
1. [Interaction Component](3a_interaction_component.md) - Core detection and handling
2. [Interactable Interface](3b_interactable_interface.md) - Common interface for all interactable objects
3. [Position Adjustment System](3c_position_adjustment.md) - Precise character positioning during interactions
4. [Environmental Object Types](3d_environmental_objects.md) - Different interactable object implementations

## Getting Started

Begin by implementing the core [Interaction Component](3a_interaction_component.md), then proceed to the other parts of the system in sequence.

Each file contains:
- Detailed implementation instructions
- Code examples 
- Integration points with other systems
- Testing guidelines

## Prerequisites

Before implementing the interaction system:
- Complete the [Character Base Implementation](1_character_base_implementation.md)
- Set up the [Animation System](2_character_animation_setup.md) 
- Understand the Timeline component used for position adjustments
- Familiarize yourself with interface implementation in UE5
