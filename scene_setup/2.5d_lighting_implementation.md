# 2.5D Lighting Implementation Guide

This document provides detailed implementation steps for creating optimized lighting specifically for 2.5D platformer games in Unreal Engine 5.5.

## Overview

Effective 2.5D lighting enhances the player's sense of depth while maintaining the side-scrolling visual language. This guide builds on the basic lighting setup from the level creation document and focuses on techniques that emphasize the 2.5D nature of your game.

## Implementing Side-Oriented Lighting

For optimal 2.5D lighting, the main lighting direction should generally be perpendicular to the player's movement plane:

1. **Configure Key Light Direction**:
   - Select your main **Directional Light**
   - Position it at coordinates:
     - For levels with floor at Z=0: X=0, Y=0, Z=1000
     - For larger levels: Position above center of playable area
     - Note: While directional light position doesn't affect lighting directly, placing it above your level makes it easier to select and visualize
   - For side lighting (best for most 2.5D games):
     - Set Rotation to X=0, Y=-90, Z=0 (light comes from right side)
     - Or X=0, Y=90, Z=0 (light comes from left side)
   - For 3/4 view lighting (adds more dimension):
     - Set Rotation to X=-30, Y=-60, Z=0 (light from front-right)
   - These angles cast shadows that emphasize depth along the Z-axis

2. **Create Depth-Enhancing Rim Light**:
   - Add a new **Directional Light** from the Place Actors panel
   - Position it at the same height or slightly higher than your key light:
     - Recommended position: X=0, Y=0, Z=1200
     - For dramatic effects, offset it slightly from center along X or Y
   - Position it opposite your main light:
     - If main light is from right, set Rotation to X=0, Y=90, Z=0
     - If main light is from left, set Rotation to X=0, Y=-90, Z=0
   - In the Details panel:
     - Set **Intensity** to 0.8-1.2
     - Set **Light Color** to a slightly warm tint (#FFE3CC)
     - Uncheck **Cast Shadows**
     - Set **Source Angle** to 1.0 for sharper edge definition
   - This creates a subtle highlight on the edges of your characters/objects

## Creating a Foreground/Background Separation System

Enhance the layered feeling of your 2.5D world:

1. **Set Up Layered Post-Process Volumes**:
   - Create three **Post Process Volumes** (don't set them to Unbound)
     - Name them "PP_Foreground", "PP_Midground", and "PP_Background"
   - Scale and position them to cover their respective depth layers:
     - Foreground: Position at X=0, Y=-100, Z=-100, Scale=X appropriate to level width, Y=5, Z=200
     - Midground: Position at X=0, Y=0, Z=100, Scale=X appropriate to level width, Y=10, Z=200  
     - Background: Position at X=0, Y=100, Z=300, Scale=X appropriate to level width, Y=20, Z=400
   - Set appropriate **Blend Weights** (1.0 for all initially)
   - Set **Blend Radius** to 50.0 for smoother transitions

2. **Configure Depth Perception Settings**:
   - For **PP_Foreground**:
     - Under **Lens → Depth of Field**:
       - Method: Gaussian
       - Focal Distance: 100
       - Depth Blur km for 50%: 0.01
       - Depth Blur Distance: 1000
     - Under **Color Grading**:
       - Shadow Contrast: 0.05
       - Shadow Gamma: 0.9
       - Saturation: 1.1

   - For **PP_Background**:
     - Under **Lens → Depth of Field**:
       - Method: Gaussian
       - Focal Distance: 500
       - Depth Blur km for 50%: 0.05
       - Depth Blur Distance: 1000
     - Under **Color Grading**:
       - Shadow Contrast: -0.1
       - Highlights: -0.2
       - Shadow Gamma: 1.1
       - Saturation: 0.8
     - Under **Rendering Features**:
       - Ambient Occlusion Intensity: 0.5
       - Bloom Intensity: 0.7

## Implementing Dynamic Time-of-Day Lighting (Optional)

For levels with time progression or for creating different moods:

1. **Create Blueprint-Controlled Lighting**:
   - Create a new **Blueprint Class** (Actor)
   - Name it "BP_TimeOfDayController"
   - Add these variables:
     - CurrentTime (Float, Range 0-24)
     - SunColor (Linear Color)
     - SunIntensity (Float)
     - SkyLightIntensity (Float)
     - FogDensity (Float)

2. **Setup the Construction Script**:
   - Add references to your lights:
     - Get Sun Light (your main directional light)
     - Get Sky Light
     - Get Exponential Height Fog

3. **Create Time-of-Day Logic**:
   - In the **Event Graph**:
     - Create a function called "UpdateTimeOfDay"
     - Add switch statements or lerp functions based on CurrentTime
     - For specific times, set appropriate values:
   
   ```
   // Morning (6:00)
   If CurrentTime ~= 6.0:
     - Sun Rotation: X=-10, Y=-90, Z=0
     - SunColor: Warm orange (#FFCC99)
     - SunIntensity: 5.0
     - SkyLightIntensity: 0.8
     - FogDensity: 0.04
     - FogColor: Light blue with orange tint
   
   // Noon (12:00)
   If CurrentTime ~= 12.0:
     - Sun Rotation: X=-60, Y=-90, Z=0
     - SunColor: White (#FFFFFF)
     - SunIntensity: 15.0
     - SkyLightIntensity: 1.2
     - FogDensity: 0.01
     - FogColor: Very light blue
   
   // Evening (18:00)
   If CurrentTime ~= 18.0:
     - Sun Rotation: X=10, Y=-90, Z=0
     - SunColor: Orange-red (#FF7F50)
     - SunIntensity: 4.0
     - SkyLightIntensity: 0.6
     - FogDensity: 0.05
     - FogColor: Purple-orange blend
   
   // Night (22:00)
   If CurrentTime ~= 22.0:
     - Sun Rotation: X=30, Y=-90, Z=0
     - SunColor: Dark blue (#334455)
     - SunIntensity: 0.5
     - SkyLightIntensity: 0.2
     - FogDensity: 0.08
     - FogColor: Dark blue
   ```

4. **Connect to Gameplay (Optional)**:
   - Add a **Timeline** to smoothly transition between times
   - Connect to level events or player triggers
   - Expose parameters to level designers through the Details panel

## Optimizing Lighting for Performance

2.5D games can maintain high visual quality with optimized lighting:

1. **Create a Light Function Material**:
   - In Content Browser: Right-click → Create Basic Asset → Material
   - Name it "M_2D_LightMask"
   - Set **Material Domain** to "Light Function"
   - Create this node setup:
     - Add a "Texture Sample" node with a soft gradient mask texture
     - Connect to "Emissive Color"
   - Apply to your directional lights to limit lighting to gameplay area

2. **Set Up Distance Field Shadows**:
   - For your main directional light:
     - Enable **Distance Field Shadows**
     - Set **Dynamic Shadow Distance StationaryLight** to 2000
     - Set **Distance Field Shadow Distance** to 1500
   - This provides efficient shadows for a 2.5D environment

3. **Create Light Channels**:
   - In Project Settings → Engine → Rendering:
     - Configure Light Channel names (e.g., "Foreground", "Midground", "Background")
   - On your lights:
     - Set appropriate channel visibility
   - On your meshes:
     - Set channel memberships based on their depth layer

4. **Implement Light Boundaries**:
   - Add **Box Reflection Captures** at section boundaries
   - Size them to cover just the active play area
   - Enable **Visible in Game** only for reflections in current section

## Stylized Lighting Effects

Create distinctive visual treatments for your 2.5D game:

1. **Implement Volumetric Spotlights**:
   - Add **Spot Lights** at key locations
   - Position them for dramatic effect:
     - Above platforms: X at platform center, Y=0, Z=100-150 above platform
     - For highlights: X at object of interest, Y=-50 to -100 (in front of plane), Z at object height
     - For mystery areas: X at area entrance, Y=0, Z slightly above player height
   - Rotation: Point toward gameplay area (typically X=0, Y=0, Z=0 or slight variations)
   - Enable **Volumetric Scattering**
   - Set **Volumetric Scattering Intensity** to 5-15
   - Set **Light Function** using cloud or noise textures
   - Position along the 2D plane for dramatic shafts of light

2. **Create Active Background Lighting**:
   - Add several **Point Lights** to background elements
   - Configure with subtle animation using **Timeline**
   - Connect light colors to game events or environmental hazards
   - Use **Light Function** to create patterns on background walls

3. **Implement Screen-Space Lighting Effects**:
   - Create a **Material** for a full-screen quad:
     - Add Fresnel effect for edge highlighting
     - Add subtle screen-space gradient for vignetting
   - Apply to a **Post Process Material**:
     - Connect to specific Post Process Volumes

## Testing and Iteration

Verify your lighting enhances the 2.5D experience:

1. **Camera Perspective Test**:
   - Enter **Play Mode** and evaluate lighting from the player's perspective
   - Check that light direction emphasizes rather than flattens depth
   - Verify foreground/background separation is clear

2. **Contrast Check**:
   - Take screenshots at different points in your level
   - Adjust lighting to ensure primary platforms/hazards remain clearly visible
   - Check that visual hierarchy supports gameplay needs

3. **Performance Verification**:
   - Enable performance stats (press ~ then type "stat fps")
   - Test on target hardware if possible
   - Identify and optimize any lighting elements causing performance issues
