# Unreal 5.5 Isometric 2.5D Game Framework Overview

## 1. Project Structure Setup
- Create a new Unreal Engine 5.5 project with C++ support
- Configure project settings for isometric perspective
- Setup folder structure for logical organization
- Enable necessary plugins (EnhancedInput, GameplayAbilitySystem, Paper2D)

## 2. Core Framework Components
- Create base GameInstance class
- Setup GameMode with turn-based/real-time systems
- Define GameState for world tracking
- Implement specialized PlayerController
- Create isometric Character base class

## 3. Camera System Setup
- Create isometric camera component
- Implement camera rotation constraints
- Setup zoom functionality
- Configure camera boundaries
- Add smooth follow and transition logic

## 4. Input System Configuration
- Setup EnhancedInput for isometric controls
- Define click-to-move or direct control actions
- Create selection system input handlers
- Implement context-sensitive inputs
- Add touch support for mobile platforms

## 5. Grid System Implementation
- Design tile-based world framework
- Create pathfinding system
- Implement A* or navigation mesh
- Setup tile highlighting and selection
- Add grid-based logic tools

## 6. Rendering Pipeline
- Configure isometric rendering settings
- Setup depth sorting for sprites/meshes
- Implement custom depth pass for outlines
- Create occlusion system for buildings/objects
- Add sprite billboarding if using 2D assets

## 7. Character Systems
